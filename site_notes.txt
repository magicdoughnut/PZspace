to get the image stuff working:
brew install imagemagic (this step may not be needed)
pip install python-magic
brew install libmagic

SCRATCH ALL THAT
python-magic is a pretty lame package and doesnt do much but reads basic file meta datainstead have to use pgmagic

brew install graphicsmagick
pip install pgmagick
